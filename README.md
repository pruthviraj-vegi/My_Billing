# My_Billing (GarageOS)

A comprehensive Django 5.1-based billing, inventory, and point-of-sale (POS) system tailored for retail and wholesale operations. It handles everything from stock tracking to compliant GST/Non-GST invoicing, customer/supplier management, barcode-driven cart checkouts, and cloud-integrated PDF generation.

### Design Patterns

- **Fat Models**: Business logic lives in Model definitions; views handle routing only
- **Signal-Driven Side Effects**: Automatic cache invalidation, credit recalculation, audit logging
- **Service Layer**: Dedicated service classes for inventory operations, PDF generation, cloud storage
- **Soft Delete**: All major models support soft delete via `SoftDeleteModel`
- **Mixins**: Reusable behavior (naming, stock, pricing) for ProductVariant

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone <repository-url>
cd My_Billing

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r require.txt
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```env

SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432

CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
REDIS_CACHE_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1

R2_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-access-key
R2_SECRET_KEY=your-r2-secret-key
R2_ENDPOINT=your-r2-endpoint
R2_INVOICE_BUCKET=invoices
R2_STATEMENT_BUCKET=statements
R2_INVOICE_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_STATEMENT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket.cloudflarestorage.com
```

### Database Setup

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createcachetable
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start Django server

# Start Celery worker (separate terminal)
celery -A Billing worker -l info
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## URL Structure

| Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `""` | Base app (login, dashboard, home) |
| `user/` | User management |
| `security/` | Security audit logs |
| `customer/` | Customer & payment management |
| `supplier/` | Supplier & purchase management |
| `inventory/` | Products, variants, stock |
| `cart/` | POS cart |
| `invoice/` | Invoicing & returns |
| `report/` | PDF reports & exports |
| `setting/` | Configuration |
| `api/` | External API endpoints |
| `notifications/` | Notification system |

---

## Development Guidelines

- **URL Namespacing**: Always namespace app URLs (e.g., `invoice:detail`)
- **Fat Models**: Keep business logic in Models; restrict views to routing
- **Decimal for Money**: Never use `float` for financial calculations
- **Atomic Transactions**: Wrap multi-model writes in `transaction.atomic()`
- **Query Optimization**: Use `select_related`/`prefetch_related` for N+1 prevention
- **Theme Variables**: Use CSS variables for theming instead of hardcoded colors
